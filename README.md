# üé¨ Movie Recommender System (Content-Based)

This is a machine learning project built to showcase practical skills in **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **similarity modeling**, and **deployment**. The goal was to create a **content-based movie recommendation system** using real-world data from TMDB (The Movie Database), and deploy it as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.

## üíº This Project Demonstrates:

- My ability to handle real-world messy data
- Feature extraction and engineering skills
- ML techniques like vectorization and cosine similarity
- End-to-end deployment of a working ML app

## üß† What I Did

### ‚úÖ Data Preparation
- Combined `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` using `title` as a key
- Extracted important features:
  - `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew` (specifically director)
- Used `ast.literal_eval` to parse stringified JSON fields

### ‚úÖ Feature Engineering
- Limited cast to top 3 actors for relevance
- Normalized and concatenated all selected features into a new column called `tags`
- Applied basic NLP preprocessing: lowercasing, removing spaces, stemming

### ‚úÖ Vectorization & Similarity
- Vectorized `tags` using `CountVectorizer` (max features: 5000, no stopwords)
- Computed cosine similarity between all movies based on tag vectors
- Saved both similarity matrix and movie metadata using `pickle` for use in frontend

### ‚úÖ Web App Frontend (Streamlit)
- Built a Streamlit UI to:
  - Let users pick a movie
  - Show 5 similar movies based on similarity
  - Fetch movie posters dynamically from TMDB API
